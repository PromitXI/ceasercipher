make 2 lists one of Alphabets one of Special characters excluding space.

this is the encrypt function, take in the word as the input parameter

input from user will be string--> make that a list
take an integer input for the encryption,
run a for loop over the user input list
take every character check if it belongs to the special character list
else find that character in the Alphabet list and find its index
add the shift to the index
id the total after addition is >27
take out that diff( eg 30 is the sum then 30-27=3)
take the alphaphabet from the beginning of the list using the difference amount

take the aslphabet from that index  in the alphabet list and replace the index position in the user input

will return list after joining


Decode function:

Will run the same thing but instead of adding the index in the alphabet list will Substract from the alphabet list.
